  aboutMe: "Hi, I am Harsh. I like doing time-pass, and this is a by-product of that. So, internet surfing is my primary work, hobby and life. I also do some productive works like sleeping, cooking, playing, cycling, reading books and watching movies. Through this page, I will travel with you along my little art and science that I pursue."
